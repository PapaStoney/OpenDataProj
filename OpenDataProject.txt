Generate Sheets based on questions and Data

 

Question Generation:
What is Goose game and what propelled this unknown game into the top 10 for highest concurrent players?
Is there a common Genre in the top 10?
Is there a commonality in how these games attracted thier player base?
What was happening when these games achieved thier rank?
Are any games that were in the top 10 reaching the top ten at all post peak?
